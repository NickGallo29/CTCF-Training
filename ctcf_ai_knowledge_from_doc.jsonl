This model allows for faster replenishment of stock and has continued to grow in popularity as retail chains fight to minimize inventory carrying costs. \n\nPre-Distro: Similar to DSD, pre-distro requires us to pack orders to the store level. After each store order is packed, the cartons are consolidated on pallets and shipped to the retailer’s DC. This model can require many man hours.\n\nDistro: Distro orders are bulk-shipped from our warehouse to the DC, where the products are sorted, stored, and later distributed to various retail store locations. \n\nDropship: Dropshipping allows your business to partner with an online retailer to display and sell your product without the retailer holding the inventory. In this model, your 3PL fulfillment partner will receive the order, pick the products from inventory, and ship directly to the customer on behalf of the retailer.", "source": "CTCF Website Copy Framework v3.docx", "last_updated": "2025-08-23"}
