title: 2025 SEO Blog Drafting Strategy
---

# Overall Rule

Write to satisfy search intent and provide complete coverage. Word count
is an output, not a goal. Never keyword-stuff.

# Blog Length Guidelines

• Quick answers / news: 400--800 words\
• How-to / checklists / definitions: 900--1,500 words\
• Comparisons / buyer's guides / "vs." pages: 1,200--2,000 words\
• Deep pillar guides / research: 1,800--3,000+ words

# Section & Paragraph Rules

• Each section (H2/H3): 150--300 words or a list/table\
• Paragraphs: 1--3 sentences; max 4--5 lines on mobile\
• Average sentence length: \~15--20 words

# Keyword Placement (No Density Targets)

## Focus Keyword

• Title/H1\
• URL slug (if natural)\
• First 100 words\
• One subhead (if natural)\
• Image alt (only if relevant)\
• Meta description

## Secondary Keywords

3--8 per post. Assign each to a sub-question or section. Use natural
variations and synonyms.

## FAQ Block

3--6 question-style queries (How/What/Why/Compare).

# Structuring for AI Overviews & Snippets

• Lead with a concise answer (1--3 sentences or list) before expanding.\
• Use descriptive subheads, bullets, and definitions.\
• Cite authoritative sources for data/claims.

# On-Page Essentials

• Natural, descriptive titles and subheads.\
• Internal links: 3--7 per post, with descriptive anchors.\
• Images: use contextual alt text, no stuffing.\
• Schema: Article + FAQ/HowTo (as relevant).\
• Show publish/update date clearly.\
• Keep content scannable and readable.

# Blog Post Template

1\. H1 with focus keyword\
2. Intro (80--120 words): problem → promise → preview\
3. Key takeaways box (3--5 bullets)\
4. Body (5--8 H2s): 150--300 words each; map to secondary
keywords/questions\
5. Comparison table / checklist (if relevant)\
6. FAQ (3--6 Qs)\
7. Conclusion + CTA\
8. References / sources (2--5 authoritative)\
9. Schema (Article + FAQ/HowTo)

# Coast to Coast Fulfillment Notes

For posts like "apparel fulfillment," "3PL ecommerce," "kitting and
assembly services":\
• Target 1,200--2,000 words.\
• Must-have sections: costs, SLAs, receiving, packaging, returns,
integrations, "who it's for / not for."\
• Style: clear, professional, conversational.
