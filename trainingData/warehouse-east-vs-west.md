# Intro

Choosing where to base your warehousing fulfillment services can make or
break your logistics strategy. With shipping costs climbing and customer
expectations for fast delivery at an all-time high, the question isn't
just about finding warehouse space --- it's about finding the right
warehouse space. This comprehensive guide compares East Coast and West
Coast warehousing, covering everything from population reach and
shipping zones to costs, ports, and logistics optimization.

Let's explore the benefits and drawbacks to each warehouse location and
discover why many growing brands start on the East Coast initially to
achieve the most cost-effect, nationwide fulfillment service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Warehouse Location Matters in Order Fulfillment

Your warehouse location isn't just an address on a map---it's the
strategic center of your entire fulfillment operation. The right
location determines your shipping costs, delivery speeds, and
ultimately, your customer satisfaction.

Think of warehouse location strategies like choosing the hub for an
airline. Just as airlines place major hubs in cities that give them the
best access to the most destinations, smart eCommerce brands position
their inventory where it can reach the largest number of customers in
the shortest time, at the lowest cost.

### What are Shipping Zones and How They Work

Shipping zones are geographic regions that carriers like UPS, FedEx, and
USPS use to calculate shipping costs and delivery times. The further
your package travels from its origin, the higher the zone number---and
the higher the cost.

Here's how it works: If you're shipping from a warehouse in New York to
a customer in Philadelphia, you're looking at Zone 2 shipping. But ship
that same package from New York to Los Angeles, and you're hitting Zone
8. Each zone jump increases your shipping cost by approximately 10-15%
and adds at least one business day to delivery time.

This zone system is why logistics optimization starts with geography.
Position your inventory closer to more customers, and you'll
automatically lower your average shipping zones---saving money on every
single order while delivering a faster service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## East Coast Warehousing Advantages

The East Coast offers unmatched advantages for brands looking to serve
the broadest customer base efficiently. Here's why East Coast
warehousing consistently outperforms other regions for nationwide
fulfillment services:

### Population Density Power

Coast to Coast Fulfillment, based in Rhode Island, sits in the heart of
the Northeast Corridor---home to over 60 million people. From this
strategic position, East Coast warehousing covers more than 70% of the
U.S. population within 1-3-day ground shipping. Your products can reach
major metropolitan areas like New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and
Washington, D.C. within 1-2 days.

Now compare this to west coast warehousing, which can serve the West
Coast quickly but leaves much of the U.S. population in higher shipping
zones. You might reach some customers faster, but you're leaving most
behind, restricting most of your customers to longer shipping times and
increased costs.

### Lower Average Zones for Maximum Savings

When you run the numbers on east coast fulfillment services, the zone
advantages are crystal clear. The key is identifying where the major
population centers fall in relation to your warehouse.

From Rhode Island (East Coast Fulfillment): - Zone 1-2: Northeast
megalopolis (60+ million people) -- New York, Boston, Philadelphia in
1-2 days - Zone 3-4: Midwest and Southeast (150+ million people) --
Chicago, Atlanta, Miami in 2-3 days - Zone 5-6: Most of Texas, Mountain
West -- Dallas, Denver in 3-4 days - Zone 7-8: West Coast and Far West
-- Only California and far western states

From California (West Coast Fulfillment): - Zone 1-2: West Coast region
(50+ million people) -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle in 1-2
days - Zone 3-4: Mountain West states -- Denver, Phoenix in 2-3 days -
Zone 5-6: Central states -- Texas, parts of Midwest in 3-4 days - Zone
7-8: East Coast megalopolis (210+ million people) -- New York, Chicago,
Atlanta in 4-5+ days

From Rhode Island, 210+ million Americans live in low-cost Zones 1-4,
while from California, those same 210+ million Americans live in
expensive Zones 5-8.

This distribution means your average shipping zone stays dramatically
lower when shipping from the East Coast, directly translating to cost
savings on every order. For many brands, this can reduce postage
expenses by 15-25% compared to west coast warehousing.

### Port Access and Infrastructure

East Coast warehouses benefit from access to some of North America's
most efficient ports: New York/New Jersey (the largest on the East
Coast), Savannah (fastest growing), and Miami (gateway to Latin
America). These ports handle massive volumes of international cargo
while maintaining faster processing times than their congested West
Coast counterparts.

The infrastructure supporting east coast fulfillment services includes
multiple interstate highways (I-95, I-85, I-75), extensive rail
networks, and numerous airports---all designed to move goods efficiently
throughout the eastern United States and beyond.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## West Coast Warehousing Advantages (and Drawbacks)

West Coast warehousing isn't without its benefits, but these advantages
apply to specific business models and geographic focuses.

### When West Coast Makes Sense

West coast 3PL services excel in these scenarios: - **Proximity to Asia
Imports:** If you're importing exclusively by ocean freight from
Asia-Pacific countries, West Coast warehousing can reduce your inbound
logistics costs. Major ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, and
Seattle handle the majority of trans-Pacific container traffic. -
Important caveat: This advantage only applies to ocean shipments. While
West Coast proximity has historically been a major advantage for ocean
shipments, many brands are now shifting some or all of their imports to
air freight due to rising costs and the unpredictability of ocean
transit times. In these cases, proximity to West Coast ports provides
little to no advantage. - **Regional West Coast Focus:** Businesses
serving primarily California, Oregon, Washington, and parts of Nevada
may benefit from West Coast 3PL services for local delivery speed.

### The West Coast Challenges

However, West Coast warehousing comes with significant drawbacks for
nationwide brands: - **Higher Zones to Major Markets:** Shipping from
California to New York puts you in Zone 8---the highest and most
expensive shipping zone. This means higher costs for reaching the 70% of
Americans who live east of the Mississippi River. - **Port Congestion
Risks:** West Coast ports frequently experience congestion, labor
disputes, and capacity constraints. The 2021-2022 supply chain crisis
highlighted these vulnerabilities, with ships waiting weeks to unload at
Los Angeles and Long Beach. - **Limited Nationwide Reach:** While west
coast warehousing serves the West Coast efficiently, it struggles to
provide cost-effective service to the Midwest, South, and
Northeast---where most U.S. consumers live. - **Higher Operating
Costs:** Commercial real estate, warehouse leases, and labor are
significantly more expensive on the West Coast compared to many central
and eastern U.S. locations. These overhead costs often translate into
higher fulfillment expenses for brands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cost & Speed Comparison: East Coast vs West Coast

The numbers tell the story. Here's how east coast warehousing compares
to west coast warehousing for nationwide fulfillment:

**Figure 1 Population Data from Census Bureau's Vintage 2024**

**The Bottom Line:** East Coast warehousing provides faster, more
affordable shipping to 265+ million Americans, while west coast
warehousing only optimizes for the 50 million people on the West Coast.

For most brands, this translates to: - 15-25% lower average shipping
costs - 1-2 days faster average delivery times - Higher customer
satisfaction scores - Reduced shipping zone penalties

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## East Coast vs.Â West Coast 3PL

The service landscape differs significantly between coasts, with East
Coast fulfillment services offering more comprehensive solutions for
growing brands.

### East Coast Advantages: Comprehensive Nationwide Solutions

East Coast fulfillment providers like Coast to Coast Fulfillment
specialize in omnichannel fulfillment that reaches every customer
efficiently. Services typically include: - Advanced inventory management
with real-time visibility - Omnichannel integration (eCommerce, retail,
B2B, marketplaces) - Specialized services like kitting, assembly, and
subscription box fulfillment - EDI compliance for major retailers
(Target, Walmart, Amazon, etc.) - Returns management and reverse
logistics - Customer service outsourcing

The infrastructure supporting East Coast fulfillment services has
evolved to handle complex, nationwide distribution requirements.

### West Coast 3PL: Import-Heavy, Regionally Focused

West Coast 3PL providers excel at these specific functions: - Ocean
freight receiving and cross-docking - Import processing and customs
coordination - Regional West Coast distribution - Basic fulfillment for
local markets

However, many West Coast 3PL operations focus heavily on import
logistics and cross-docking rather than the comprehensive fulfillment
services that growing eCommerce brands need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Actually Choose West Coast Warehousing

Despite the nationwide advantages of East Coast warehousing, certain
business models do benefit from West Coast 3PL services:

### Heavy Asia-Pacific Import Reliance (Ocean Only)

Brands importing exclusively by ocean freight from Asia-Pacific
countries can benefit from West Coast warehousing---but only if: - 100%
of inventory arrives via ocean freight (not air) - Inbound logistics
costs outweigh the higher outbound shipping zones - Import volumes are
substantial enough to negotiate preferential port rates - Cross-docking
as a primary need

### Predominantly West Coast Customer Base

If your brand serves primarily California, Oregon, Washington, and
Nevada customers, west coast warehousing makes geographical sense. This
applies to: - Regional brands with localized customer bases - Niche
products with concentrated West Coast demand - B2B companies serving
Western manufacturers or retailers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Many Brands Start East Coast First

Smart brands approach warehouse location as a foundation for growth, not
just a cost center. Here's why East Coast warehousing serves as the
optimal starting point:

### Access to the Largest Addressable Market

Starting with east coast warehousing gives you immediate access to the
largest addressable market at the lowest average shipping costs. Coast
to Coast Fulfillment's Rhode Island location exemplifies this
strategy---positioned to reach major metropolitan areas within 1-2 days
while maintaining cost-effective shipping to secondary markets.

This approach means: - Lower customer acquisition costs (cheaper
shipping = higher conversion rates) - Better unit economics (lower
fulfillment costs improve margins) - Faster scaling (reach more
customers efficiently as you grow)

### Easier Path to Bi-Coastal Expansion

As brands mature and order volumes increase, many adopt a bi-coastal
fulfillment strategy: - **Phase 1:** Establish East Coast warehousing
for nationwide coverage - **Phase 2:** Add West Coast warehousing for
regional optimization

However, this strategy requires careful planning: - **SKU Count
Challenges:** Brands with large product catalogs face doubled storage
fees when splitting inventory between two locations. Each additional SKU
stored in both warehouses increases monthly storage costs. -
**Expiration Date Complexity:** Products with expiration dates
(supplements, food, cosmetics) become exponentially more complex to
manage across multiple locations. You must ensure the correct expiration
dates are available in the right warehouse for specific retail
orders---critical for maintaining compliance with major retailers. -
**Volume Requirements:** Successfully operating multiple fulfillment
centers requires sufficient order volume to justify the complexity. Most
brands need at least 13,000+ orders per month per location to make
bi-coastal strategies economically viable.

### Superior Zone Coverage for Nationwide Delivery

The zone mathematics of East Coast warehousing creates a natural
advantage for nationwide fulfillment services. From Coast to Coast
Fulfillment's Rhode Island location: - 60+ million people reach in 1-2
days (Zones 1-2) - 150+ million people reach in 2-3 days (Zones 3-4) -
Only 50+ million people require 4+ days (Zones 7-8)

This distribution means that 80% of your customers receive faster
service while you maintain lower shipping costs. The result? Higher
customer satisfaction, better reviews, and improved repeat purchase
rates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion: Which Coast Is Best for Your Business? (CTCF CTA)

Both East Coast warehousing and West Coast warehousing offer value, but
the mathematics of U.S. population distribution make east coast
warehousing the superior starting point for most growing brands.

**Choose East Coast Warehousing If:** - You serve customers nationwide -
You want to minimize average shipping costs - Fast delivery to major
metropolitan areas is important - You're building a scalable, long-term
fulfillment strategy

**Choose West Coast Warehousing If:** - Your customers are primarily
West Coast-based - You import exclusively, and very frequently, by ocean
freight from Asia - Your product category has strong West Coast
affinity - Regional focus outweighs nationwide efficiency

For most brands, the path forward is clear: start with east coast
fulfillment services to build a strong foundation, then consider adding
west coast 3PL services as a supplement when volumes justify the
complexity.

## FAQ Section

**What are shipping zones and why do they matter?**\
Shipping zones are geographic regions used by carriers to calculate
costs and delivery times. Domestic Zones range from 1 (closest) to 8
(farthest), with each zone increasing shipping costs by 10-15% and added
delivery time. Lower average zones mean lower shipping costs and faster
delivery, which is why warehouse location directly impacts your
profitability and customer satisfaction.

**Is East Coast or West Coast better for eCommerce fulfillment?**\
East Coast warehousing is better for most eCommerce brands because it
provides faster, more cost-effective shipping to 70%+ of U.S. consumers.
East Coast fulfillment services can reach major metropolitan areas in
1-2 days while maintaining lower average shipping zones nationwide. West
coast warehousing only optimizes for the 15% of Americans living on the
West Coast.

**Which coast is cheaper for warehousing fulfillment services?**\
East coast warehousing typically provides 15-25% lower average shipping
costs for nationwide brands due to lower shipping zones to major
population centers. In addition, overall operating costs---such as
warehouse leases, labor, and utilities---are generally lower on the East
Coast compared to the West Coast. Rhode Island, in particular, offers a
strategic location with cost efficiencies that further enhance the
savings. Taken together, these factors make East Coast fulfillment a
more cost-effective option for brands serving customers nationwide.

**Should brands use a bi-coastal fulfillment strategy?**\
Bi-coastal strategies work for established brands with high order
volumes (3,000+ orders per location monthly), but they're complex and
expensive. Challenges include doubled storage fees for each SKU,
complicated expiration date tracking, and increased operational
complexity. Most brands achieve better results starting with east coast
warehousing and adding west coast 3PL services only when volumes clearly
justify the added complexity.

**How does warehouse location affect my eCommerce strategy?**\
Warehouse location impacts every aspect of your eCommerce strategy:
shipping costs (affecting your margins and pricing competitiveness),
delivery speed (influencing customer satisfaction and retention), and
scalability (determining how efficiently you can grow nationwide).
Strategic east coast warehousing can reduce shipping costs by 15-25%
while improving delivery times to major markets, directly improving your
unit economics and customer experience.
