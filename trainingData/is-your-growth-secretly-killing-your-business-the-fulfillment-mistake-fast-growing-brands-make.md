# Is Your Growth Secretly Killing Your Business? The Fulfillment Mistake Fast-Growing Brands Make

Your ads are crushing it. Sales notifications are lighting up your phone. From the outside, your brand is a rocketship.

So why does it feel like you’re drowning?

This is the dangerous paradox of growth for so many ecommerce brands. The very success you worked so hard for creates a new kind of chaos—a logistical nightmare where every new order adds more stress, not more satisfaction. Your team stops innovating and starts putting out fires. Customer complaints about shipping pile up. Your brand’s reputation, once your greatest asset, starts to take a hit.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. This exact scenario almost derailed one of the biggest DTC success stories out there: Dr. Squatch.

## The story of Dr. Squatch’s exploding success (and hidden chaos)

With their brilliant marketing and all-natural products, Dr. Squatch built a legion of adoring fans. They were the picture of a thriving brand. But behind the scenes, fulfillment was failing. Badly. They were stuck in a frustrating cycle: shipping delays, wrong orders, and a revolving door of 3PL partners who couldn’t keep up.

> “We were almost on an annual journey, recreating the wheel, trying to find a 3PL partner that could grow with us,” admitted Jason Welsh, their Senior Manager of Ecommerce.

The brand had reached a breaking point. They could continue patching the leaks on a sinking ship, or they could find a partner to help them build a new one. They made the leap to ShipMonk, and in doing so, they learned a few powerful lessons that every growing brand needs to hear.

### Lesson 1: you need flexibility, not a logistical straitjacket

Many brands find themselves locked into a single carrier network that can’t handle pressure. When things get busy or a carrier underperforms, everything grinds to a halt.

Dr. Squatch escaped this trap by leveraging ShipMonk’s Virtual Carrier Network (VCN) . Think of it as a “Choose Your Own Adventure” for shipping. Instead of being stuck, they gained the power to pivot to the best-performing, most affordable carrier for any situation.

> “With ShipMonk’s carrier network, we’re never pigeonholed. We always have options,” said Andrew Sutton, Sr. Director of Fulfillment Logistics. It’s the difference between being reactive and being resilient.

### Lesson 2: you can’t fix what you can’t see

How can you make smart decisions about inventory, staffing, or promotions if your fulfillment data is a black box? For Dr. Squatch, gaining clarity was like trading fuzzy binoculars for night-vision goggles.

ShipMonk’s platform gave them a single, crystal-clear dashboard to see everything: stock levels, shipping performance, order accuracy, and more. This visibility turned fulfillment from a source of anxiety into a source of intelligence. They could plan for the future instead of just reacting to the past.

## The payoff: what happens when fulfillment isn’t a distraction?

When Dr. Squatch stopped fighting fires, they were free to focus on growth again. So what does a true operational transformation look like? The numbers don’t lie.

Within just six months, they saw a radical shift:

- 50% Faster Shipping: Delivery times were cut in half, from 7-8 days down to under 4 days.
- Near-Perfect Accuracy: Order accuracy soared to over 99.5% , delighting customers.
- Customer Tickets Vanished: Fulfillment-related support tickets plummeted, freeing up their team.
- Smarter Operations: Fewer errors meant fewer costly returns and more efficient spending.
The best part? “Fulfillment is no longer a bottleneck,” Welsh said. “It’s peace of mind.”

## Stop drowning, start scaling

Dr. Squatch’s story is a powerful reminder that your fulfillment operation isn’t just a cost center—it’s the engine for your customer experience and a potential competitive advantage.

If you’re feeling the chaos of growth, it might be time to ask if your current system is built for where you’re going, or just for where you’ve been. Solving your fulfillment puzzle doesn’t just speed up shipping; it unlocks the full potential of your brand. Get a quote today.
