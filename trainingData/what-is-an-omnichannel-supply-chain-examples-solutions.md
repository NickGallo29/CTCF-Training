Even though people are shopping in multiple ways (online, in store, through apps, etc.), they still expect everything to work smoothly together. As a result, businesses now need to make sure the shopping experience feels the same across all these options. To keep up with what customers want, it’s important for companies to use an omnichannel supply chain that connects everything.

In this post, we’ll walk through what an omnichannel supply chain is, how your business can benefit from it, common challenges, and how to upgrade your omnichannel supply chain to achieve sustainable growth.

## What is an omnichannel supply chain?

An omnichannel supply chain refers to a single supply chain that coordinates producing, transporting, and delivering goods for all of a business’s sales channels.

Essentially, rather than having a separate supply chain for each sales channel a business uses (i.e., one for their ecommerce store, one for their retail business, one for their Amazon store, etc.), a business has one supply chain that manages all of its sourcing, production, and product distribution.

An omnichannel supply chain seamlessly integrates operations for different sales channels and ensures a smooth flow of goods between them for effective omnichannel fulfillment .

### Key components of an omnichannel supply chain

There are several elements that are crucial for building an omnichannel supply chain.

#### Unified inventory management

Inventory data is shared in real time across all digital and physical channels. This provides the business with real-time visibility into stock levels, and to sync inventory counts across channels using a single pool of inventory.

This lets customers view what’s in stock and purchase it through their preferred channel, without the business having to worry about accidentally selling stock they don’t have.

#### Automated order processing

Orders are processed automatically using a centralized order management system. This ensures that order information is automatically shared across relevant channels, which kickstarts the fulfillment process.

#### Personalized shopping experiences

An omnichannel supply chain lets you pass and share relevant data across various channels, which allows you to deliver personalized experiences for each customer.

For instance, you can tailor your business’s offers and ads to appeal to individual shoppers across various touchpoints and channels.

#### Cross-channel fulfillment

In an omnichannel supply chain, businesses can offer flexible multi-channel fulfillment options so that customers can choose how they’re like to receive their order. For example, shoppers could choose to buy online and pick up in-store (BOPIS), opt for curb-side pick-up, ship-from-store to get the order shipped to their doorstep, and more.

#### Streamlined logistics

With only one supply chain to manage, a business can greatly streamline their procurement and logistics operations. More importantly, information and tracking data are shared in real-time with relevant parties, which helps maintain visibility and address possible delays that could disrupt operations.

### Benefits of adopting an omnichannel approach

Implementing an omnichannel approach to supply chain management benefits ecommerce businesses in a number of ways.

#### Consistent customer experience

An omnichannel retail supply chain ensures that your customers can enjoy a consistent shopping experience, no matter which channel they use to interact with your brand.

Whether they decide to browse online or visit your brick-and-mortar store, customers can pick up right where they left off on a different channel and enjoy an uninterrupted shopping experience. This significantly boosts customer satisfaction, which eventually contributes to better customer loyalty.

#### Increased sales opportunities

With an omnichannel supply chain, ecommerce stores can sell on more channels, more easily. This helps you meet customers where they are, and opens up more platforms for customers to browse and buy — no matter which channel they decide to use.

Not only does this lower the chances that a customer will go somewhere else to find the product they’re looking for, but it also creates more opportunities to generate sales and drive revenue for your business.

#### Enhanced supply chain efficiency

With the automation and real-time inventory syncing central to an omnichannel supply chain, you can significantly speed up various operational processes. As a result, you can reduce shipping and fulfillment times, allowing you to enjoy increased supply chain efficiency .

## Understanding the difference between omnichannel and multichannel supply chains

At first glance, omnichannel and multichannel ecommerce strategies may seem similar enough — after all, both involve businesses maintaining a presence across different channels, so customers can interact with them through both online and offline channels.

The key distinction is that in omnichannel ecommerce, the channels are seamlessly connected to provide a unified experience. Meanwhile, in a multichannel supply chain, different sales channels typically function on their own, with siloed systems and minimal visibility.

### Integration vs. independence in channel management

In omnichannel supply chains, the different channels are integrated to create a seamless shopping experience. That means customers can easily switch from one channel to the other without interrupting their buying journey. Pricing and support are consistent across these channels, allowing customers to enjoy a unified experience.

In a multichannel supply chain, on the other hand, different channels function independently. With less data exchange and synchronization, there’s a risk of disruptions and disconnect that could negatively influence the customer experience. For instance, inventory information may be out of sync, leading online stores to display items as available even when they’ve run out of stock in stores and distribution centers.

### Customer engagement comparison

Due to various touchpoints being interconnected in an omnichannel supply chain, customers can seamlessly engage with the brand no matter which channel they use.

For instance, they can browse products online, check in-store availability, buy them online, and choose to pick them up from the store on the same day. They may also be able to use an app to locate products in-store or use AR technology to view the products in their homes.

Meanwhile, customer engagement across different touchpoints in a multichannel supply chain tends to be inconsistent and disconnected. For instance, customers may see lower prices online compared to in-store prices, or they may have no way to check if the product they’re viewing online is available at a nearby store.

## Challenges in omnichannel supply chain management

Although an omnichannel supply chain ultimately improves your bottom line, managing one comes with a few complexities. These include:

- Data consistency: Without the right technology, businesses can struggle to maintain consistent product information and inventory data across various channels. This often leads to a disconnect between different channels, resulting in inaccurate data.
- Inventory discrepancy : Inventory systems may fail to sync in real-time across different channels (which is common for brands dealing with high order volumes and high in-store traffic with fast-moving products). As a result, there’s a higher risk of stockouts, overstocking, and miscommunications.
- Omnichannel fulfillment: it can be hard to efficiently fulfill orders across different channels — especially without a fulfillment partner. Businesses have to deal with logistics complexities to ensure that orders across every channel are fulfilled efficiently while keeping shipping times and costs low.
### Integrating technology solutions

Some of the biggest challenges that come with omnichannel supply chains can be solved through integrating your technology.

When your various ecommerce platforms and technology solutions are seamlessly connected, order information and relevant inventory data are automatically shared. This removes a lot of the manual workload of managing multiple channels, and reduces the opportunity for human error.

For instance, ShipBob’s fulfillment platform integrates with leading ecommerce websites and other tools so that various sales channels are connected. This helps you maintain real-time inventory visibility by collecting data on your offline and online orders and updating inventory information across all your sales channels. It supports automated order processing and ensures that stock levels in your inventory platform are updated accordingly.

With this level of accuracy, you can access consistent inventory information across every sales channel and use it to inform other aspects of your operation, such as procurement and inventory planning. You’ll be able to accurately forecast demand, make timely replenishment orders, minimize backorders, and prevent the risk of stockouts.

#### Our Place

ShipBob’s sophisticated technology and distributed fulfillment network played a crucial role in the omnichannel success of Our Place . With an API that’s agnostic to the merchant’s preferred backend solution, Our Place was able to seamlessly collect order data from various channels to unify their fulfillment operations.

The viral cookware brand also relied on ShipBob to handle both DTC and B2B orders, maintaining unified inventory across all channels. In addition to fulfilling DTC orders online, Our Place was able to seamlessly expand their presence through retail channels such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Target, and Saks.

By managing all these orders through ShipBob’s warehouse network and expanding to four warehouses, the brand significantly reduced their freight costs. They’ve since been able to save $1.5 million in freight costs while reducing fulfillment speed by 50%.

#### Taste Salud

For Taste Salud , selling through multiple channels was a major reason for their business going from $350k in sales in their first six months to $4 million sales in 2022, which then tripled in 2023. While the brand was already fulfilling their DTC orders through ShipBob, they were able to leverage ShipBob’s B2B fulfillment solutions to expand to other channels such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon.

With ShipBob serving as a single source of truth for all these sales channels, Taste Salud was able to access real-time inventory data to inform their decisions. The platform’s built-in reporting provides valuable data on inventory levels at various fulfillment centers, average fulfillment time, and cost of fulfillment to make data-backed decisions.

Additionally, as the brand was constantly experiencing stockouts during their first couple of years, they wanted to maintain optimal inventory levels at every location. The ShipBob Inventory Placement Program allowed them to strategically improve their inventory allocation and ensure inventory availability. As a result, customers have been able to receive their orders in just a couple of days.

> “Running your own warehouse, you have to go out and hire very experienced people, invest in equipment, build in automation – and often, you’re wasting a lot of time, energy, resources, and human capital for a sub-par result. Why do that when a partner like ShipBob exists, and makes fulfillment so easy at a fair price?”

For PetLab , being an omnichannel brand is critical to reach more pet lovers across different channels. ShipBob’s DTC and B2B fulfillment solutions have enabled them to keep up with customer demand from all the places where the brand maintains a presence.
