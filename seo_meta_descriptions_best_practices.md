# Writing Meta Descriptions for Landing Pages

## Why Meta Descriptions Matter

Meta descriptions are HTML attributes that provide a concise summary of a page. They do **not** directly influence search rankings, yet they play a critical role in how users perceive a listing in search results and they can increase click-through rates (CTR). By communicating value and aligning with user intent, a well-written meta description can improve visibility, CTR, and ultimately lead conversions.

## Core SEO Guidelines (2025)

- **Length**: 150–160 characters for desktop; under 120 for mobile. Google sometimes displays up to 320 characters, but truncation is common.  
- **Uniqueness**: Each page must have a unique description. Avoid duplicates.  
- **Keywords**: Naturally include target keywords early in the description. They will appear bolded in SERPs when matching the query.  
- **No stuffing**: Don’t overload with keywords; prioritize clarity and readability.  
- **Avoid quotes & special characters**: These can break formatting in search results.

## Copywriting Best Practices

- **Value-driven**: Communicate what the visitor will gain (benefits, solutions, offers).  
- **Active voice**: Use engaging, persuasive phrasing.  
- **Call to action (CTA)**: Encourage clicks with prompts like “Learn more,” “Get started,” “Shop now,” or “Discover how.”  
- **User intent alignment**: Tailor copy to whether the searcher is researching, comparing, or ready to buy.  
- **Highlight differentiators**: Unique selling points, trust signals, or offers.  
- **Emotional triggers**: Words like “easy,” “fast,” “proven,” or “exclusive” can boost CTR.
